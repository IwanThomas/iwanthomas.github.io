<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction">&#182;</a></h3><p>Critical thinking (CT) is a key professional skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having good CT skills enables you to ask intelligent questions on a topic, even if you’re not familiar with it.</li>
<li>The more senior you become, the more ambiguous the problems and decisions. CT enables us to understand arguments, to decompose them, to surface assumptions (that are often unstated) and to evaluate the quality of the reasoning used. This is a huge benefit to ourselves and an important contribution to the organisations / communities that we form part of.</li>
<li>As the world becomes more complex, these skills become more valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Asking the Right Questions</em> is a short and accessible introduction to critical thinking.</p>
<h3 id="Why-should-you-read-this-book?">Why should you read this book?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-should-you-read-this-book?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Here’s the fundamental premise of this book:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of us are expert in all parts of life, so we often rely on the opinion of others. We cannot watch every film that’s released so listen to film critics. We can’t become medical experts so follow the advice of doctors. Typically, if you ask multiple experts in each domain for their opinion, you’ll hear disagreement. One film critic may think a film is a 1/10 that should be avoided at all cost whilst the other sees it as a 10/10 masterpiece. How are we, the consumer of opinions, to decide which of these to make our own? This book is the authors’ answer to that question: critical thinking consists of a series of questions and attitudes designed to probe and understand the quality of a person’s reasoning and allow us to decide which opinions to make our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that sounds interesting, read on! Some of my key takeaways included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A framework for working through these things. Asking the right questions is still not easy - you’ll need creativity and judgement - but it’s a good model to have in your mind.</li>
<li>The chapter on rival causes is a great introduction to thinking about causality.</li>
<li>The role that value assumptions play in our opinions &amp; the value we can bring by surfacing the weighting that different individuals give to different values.</li>
<li>The importance of identifying significant omitted information, before coming to a conclusion on an issue.</li>
<li>A list of reasoning fallacies that you can look for in your work and the works of others.</li>
</ul>

The focus in the second half of the book shifts to evaluating the quality of the reasoning used and the extent to which the reasons support the conclusion.<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-book-consists-of-two-sections:-the-first-half-describes-how-to-break-an-argument-into-its-constituent-parts.-The-focus-in-the-second-half-of-the-book-shifts-to-evaluating-the-quality-of-the-reasoning-used-and-the-extent-to-which-the-reasons-support-the-conclusion.">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first step in critically evaluating an argument is identifying it - both the visible and invisible parts. Once you have a picture of the entire argument, you’ll be much better placed to assess its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>There are four elements you need to look out for in an argument. The first two can typically be found in the argument (although they’re not always clearly stated); they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue &amp; the conclusion - what’s being discussed and the author’s stance</li>
<li>The reasons - the evidence provided to support the conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve now found the visible parts of the argument. But there will often be less visible elements to an argument that are important in assessing the reasoning. These comprise the last two elements, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambiguities - what words or phrases could have a different meaning, particularly when the different meanings impacts how well the reasons support the conclusion.</li>
<li>Assumptions - what are the unstated assumptions made by the communicator?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at each one of these in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="The-issue-and-the-conclusion">The issue and the conclusion<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-issue-and-the-conclusion">&#182;</a></h3><p>We cannot critically evaluate an argument until we understand what’s being discussed (the issue) and the message that the writer wants you to accept (the conclusion). Example issues include:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should we raise the minimum wage?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusions are answers to these questions</p>
<blockquote><p>We should raise the minimum wage because …</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="The-reasons">The reasons<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-reasons">&#182;</a></h4><p>Reasons are used to support the conclusions made by the author. Here’s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Genetic screening of embryos should not be allowed [the issue &amp; conclusion] because people should not be allowed to play God [reason]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we can identify the issue, the conclusion and the reasons, we can begin to decompose arguments into their constituent parts. For a given passage, we can pull out the issue, the conclusion and the reasons that support it and use this to more clearly assess the communicator’s reasoning.</p>
<h3 id="Ambiguities">Ambiguities<a class="anchor-link" href="#Ambiguities">&#182;</a></h3><p>You cannot assess an argument until you understand it. And ambiguities act as a barrier to that understanding. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does earning a high wage make you happy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the ambiguities here? A “high wage” and “happy” can mean different things to different people. Is a high wage enough money to be able to afford a weekly coffee, or enough to buy a luxury car? To be able to understand the author’s argument, you’ll want to understand what they mean by “high wage”.</p>
<p>For this reason, you need to get into the habit of asking “What do you mean?” to ensure that your understanding of the argument is the same as the communicator’s. Let’s look at another passage from the book containing ambiguities:</p>
<blockquote><p>We absolutely must put limits on tanning. Tanning is a substantial health risk with severe consequences. Studies have shown that those who tan are at a higher risk of skin diseases as a result of tanning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, we cannot agree with the author’s conclusion because there’s no clear suggestion or recommendation - what do they mean by “put limits”? But even if there were a clear recommendation, there are a number of ambiguities which would prevent us from understanding how well the reasons support the conclusion. What does the author mean by tanning? Is it tanning in natural sunlight or under sun beds? Is it tanning for a long time? What about “substantial health risk” and “severe consequences”? The exact meaning of these terms has a strong impact on the degree to which the reasons support the conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="Assumptions">Assumptions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Assumptions">&#182;</a></h3><p>We’ve seen how ambiguities in language can have a material impact on the degree to which the reasons support the conclusion. By careful examining an argument, we can often identify and surface these.</p>
<p>Assumptions are an even less visible, but equally important, part of assessing arguments. Assumptions are ideas that the author takes for granted that may not be explicitly stated but form an important part of the glue that holds together the reasons and the conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="Value-assumptions">Value assumptions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Value-assumptions">&#182;</a></h3><p>Let’s begin with value assumptions (VA). If you were to ask a group of people to list values that are important to them, you’d probably find a lot of overlap. Many respondents would list honesty, loyalty, order, freedom and so on. Value assumptions describe the relative importance that an individual assigns to these values.</p>
<p>Let’s take honesty and loyalty. These two values can conflict with each other; for example, should you tell your parents about your sister’s drug habit? That is, do you place more importance on being honest to your parents or being loyal to your sister?</p>
<p>These value assumptions are context specific too. An individual may be in favour of allowing schoolchildren to wear t-shirts with political symbols, because in that context freedom of choice for the individual is more important than the welfare of the community. But in another context, that value preference may shift. For example, that same individual may not support the right of an individual to give a racist speech because the harm to the welfare of the community is too large.</p>
<p>How might this manifest itself in an argument? Consider the following example</p>
<blockquote><p>We should not legalise recreational drugs. Such drugs cause too much street violence and other crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reason only supports the conclusion if we assume that the safety of the community is more important than individual freedom / choice.</p>
<p>Often we are not explicitly aware of our own value assumptions, or those of others. But they are often an important reason why we choose particular reasons over others and come to certain conclusions. Being able to surface these assumptions in our own work and the work of others can substantially improve the decision-making of the group.</p>
<h3 id="Descriptive-assumptions">Descriptive assumptions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Descriptive-assumptions">&#182;</a></h3><p>Descriptive assumptions fall into the category of things that I typically associate with critical thinking. They’re about identifying any weaknesses in the logical structure of an argument. Let’s look at an example from the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>This car will get you to your destination, wherever it may be. I have driven this model of car on multiple occasions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make things a little easier, let’s break out the conclusion and the reason</p>
<blockquote><p>Conclusion: This car will get you where you want to go.
Reason: I have driven this model of car on multiple occasions (and it has gotten me to where I wanted to go)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the assumptions that are required for the reason to support the conclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>Note the difference between “this car” and “this model of car”. So the car that the author wrote about may not be the same as the other person’s car. Perhaps one car is much older than the other, and the model performance has changed substantially. The assumption therefore is that the model of car that both people drove is of the same quality.</li>
<li>The other assumption centres on how the car was used by both people in this situation. If the author drove the car very short distances along flat even roads, is their experience relevant to somebody who intends to drive the car over long, mountainous terrain? So the second assumption is that the type of driving done by both people will be broadly the same. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-have-we-covered-so-far?">What have we covered so far?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-have-we-covered-so-far?">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first four chapters of the book have dealt with</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying the issue and the conclusion</li>
<li>identifying the reasons</li>
<li>spotting any ambiguities</li>
<li>uncovering assumptions that are important in the context of the argument</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these steps enables us to lay out the argument in full.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding which words or phrases are ambiguous will help us understand what the communicator really intended to convey in their argument. </li>
<li>Uncovering assumptions will allow us to flesh out the argument in full. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this puts us in a much better position to assess the strengths and weaknesses of an argument. As a result, we can now shift our focus to evaluating the argument; this is the focus of the second half of the book. Our key question now becomes “To what extent do the reasons support the conclusion?”</p>
<h3 id="Reasoning-fallacies">Reasoning fallacies<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reasoning-fallacies">&#182;</a></h3><p>We’ll begin addressing this question by assessing whether there are any weaknesses in the reasoning structure. Most fallacies will fall into three groups</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasons that require assumptions for them to support the conclusion</li>
<li>Reasons that are irrelevant to the argument, but may distract us</li>
<li>Reasons that require the conclusion to be true in order for them to be relevant</li>
</ul>
<p>The book contains numerous reasoning fallacies - here are a few of my favourite ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “searching for a perfect solution” fallacy:</strong> Example: “The government should not ban fast food advertising on children’s TV, as it won’t eliminate childhood obesity”. The argument here is that unless the solution perfectly solves the problem, it’s no good. In this case, the purpose of the legislation is likely not to eliminate childhood obesity, but to reduce it. </li>
<li><strong>The “straw man” fallacy:</strong> Sometimes, an issue will be misrepresented thereby making it much easier to attack it. To combat this, whenever you hear an argument, make sure that the issue is accurately depicted. </li>
<li><strong>Explaining by naming:</strong> Example: “A daughter asks her mum why her dad has begun losing his temper more often and spends extravagantly on motorbikes? The mum responds that the dad is having a midlife crisis”. For a second, this sounds like a plausible explanation. But on closer inspection, you realise you don’t understand / cannot explain any better why the person is behaving that way. Explaining by naming the condition, in this case a midlife crisis, has made you think you understand the causes, when in fact you don’t. Not only is this inadequate, it’s also misleading - you think you understand the issue when in fact you don’t. A true answer to this question may address the dad’s job stress, marital situation, activities outside of work etc. </li>
<li><strong>A red herring:</strong> A red herring is something that intentionally distracts us from the issue. Here’s the history of the phrase from Wikipedia: <em>The term was popularized in 1807 by English polemicist William Cobbett, who told a story of having used a strong-smelling smoked fish to divert and distract hounds from chasing a rabbit.</em> Example usage: A father confronts his son, asking why he wasn’t back home before his curfew. The son may introduce a red herring by responding “Why do you always pick on me and let my sister do whatever she wants?”. If the dad’s not careful, the focus of the conversation will shift from the original issue. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="How-good-is-the-evidence?">How good is the evidence?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-good-is-the-evidence?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Evidence is anything that you use to support your conclusions. It can be personal anecdotes, research studies, testimonials, personal observations, appeals to authority. For each potential source of evidence, the authors discuss the questions we should ask to determine how well the evidence supports the claim.</p>
<h3 id="Are-there-rival-causes?">Are there rival causes?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Are-there-rival-causes?">&#182;</a></h3><p>This chapter makes me think about the critical thinking skills that the best data scientists possess.</p>
<p>It talks about rival causes - these are other plausible causal mechanisms that can explain an event. Often authors will present the causal mechanism that explains their findings without mentioning the other rival causes that may be at play. Look out for these - if there are other rival causes that could explain an event, and these aren’t addressed, it reduces the confidence we have in the cause originally offered by the author.</p>
<p>An example given in the book illustrates rival causes.</p>
<p>Example 3. A research study.</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent study suggests that breast-feeding benefits mothers as well as babies. The study found that women who had breast-fed for more than a year in their entire lifetimes were almost 10 percent less likely to have had a heart attack or a stroke in their postmenopausal years than those who had never breast-fed. They were also less likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. The research, published in the May issue of the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, analyzed data on some 139,681 women who had enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, a long-term national study of postmenopausal women.</p>
<p>In this study, the researcher probably began with the hypothesis that breast-feeding causes health benefits for mothers, and she found evidence consistent with this hypothesis. But let us offer different, or rival, causes for the same findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Women who breast-feed may simply on average lead more healthful lives than those who do not. For example, they may exercise more, or eat differently, than women who do not breast-feed</li>
<li>Women who choose not to breast-feed may work outside the home more hours, possibly causing more life stress and thus incurring more health problems.</li>
<li>Reasons that women reject breast-feeding may be related to having more health problems than those who choose to breast-feed. For example, mothers who are taking medications or are smokers may be concerned about the safety of breast-feeding.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few highlights that we can take from this passage:</p>
<ul>
<li>The research design used in this passage is important in assessing the strength of the evidence. In this case, we suspect that an observational study hasn’t controlled for a number of confounding factors. </li>
<li>It also shows the fun you can have in finding these rival causes and the creativity required to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other useful takeaways from this chapter include</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A cause vs the cause:</strong> People tend to oversimplify the world and look for a simple, single cause when “the” cause is really the result of a combination of contributory causes - causes that help to create a total set of conditions necessary for the event to occur. </li>
<li><strong>All causal explanations are oversimplifications to a certain degree</strong>; rarely can they offer explanations that include every single possible cause of an event. There’s a balance to be met here to ensure that a sufficient number of causal factors have been considered such that the approach isn’t excessively simplified. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Possible-Causal-Mechanisms">Possible Causal Mechanisms<a class="anchor-link" href="#Possible-Causal-Mechanisms">&#182;</a></h4><p>Usually when X and Y go together, there are four different kinds of hypotheses that may explain the events. Knowing what these are can be helpful in determining rival causes.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example from the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent study reported that smoking combats the flu … The researchers hypothesized that the nicotine from the cigarettes destroys the flu virus before it can spread and cause sickness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the potential explanations for this finding?</p>
<ul>
<li>X causes Y: Smoking does combat the flu.</li>
<li>Y causes X: People who are less susceptible to the flu are more likely to smoke.</li>
<li>X and Y are both associated with a third factor, Z: Smokers wash their hands after every smoke which makes them less likely to catch the flu.<ul>
<li>This is the explanation that’s likely to generate the most rival causes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>X and Y influence each other; that is, the relationship is bi-directional: Smoking does combat the flu and people who are less susceptible to the flu are more likely to smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Are-the-statistics-deceptive?">Are the statistics deceptive?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Are-the-statistics-deceptive?">&#182;</a></h3><p>A few good points here</p>
<ul>
<li>To calculate any statistic we must define and accurately measure certain events. So the first question is: how were these statistics obtained? For example, can we know precisely the number of people who text whilst driving?</li>
<li>To understand whether you should use a mean, median or mode, think about your distribution and what each summary metric does and does not capture.</li>
<li>If somebody provides a statistic as a percentage, would a number be better and vice-versa. Here’s an example from the book “Skydiving is much safer than most people think. In Los Angeles, 176 people died in car accidents vs 3 in skydiving accidents”. What we’d really like to understand is the percentage of all participants who died.</li>
<li>When somebody quotes a number, always look for a point of comparison. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-significant-information-is-omitted?">What significant information is omitted?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-significant-information-is-omitted?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Most communication is designed to influence us in some way. And often to do that, information which would cause us to change how we assess the reasoning is omitted. And this isn’t always intentional or malicious; there are good reasons why there will always be omitted information. We work to deadlines and don’t have infinite time to consider our positions; we know that people’s attention spans are short and try to be brief; our knowledge of the situation is incomplete.</p>
<p>Our motivating question was:</p>
<blockquote><p>How are we, the consumer of opinions, to decide which of these to make our own?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we assess reasoning based only on the explicit parts of an argument, we gain an incomplete understanding of the issue. For example, the communicator may have focused on the benefits of a certain policy, but we would like to understand any negative consequences before forming our opinion.</p>
<p>Because of this, we want to probe an argument for any missing information before determining what opinions we want to make our own.</p>
<p>Identifying significant omitted information is a creative process. We must step back and ask ourselves what possible information we’d like to know to make a decision and assess whether that’s provided. Let’s look at an example from the book</p>
<blockquote><p>Zitout brand facial cleanser removes 95 percent of deep-down dirt and oil, helping to fight unsightly blemishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company Zitout is trying to convince us to buy its facial cleanser. What significant information may be omitted that would be important for us in making that decision?</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the Zitout facial cleanser compare to other brands? Is removing 95% of deep-down dirt and oil good?</li>
<li>How does it compare to just washing your face with hot water &amp; soap?</li>
<li>How much of a role does removing deep-down dirt and oil have on fighting unsightly blemishes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst the questions that you want to ask will be context-specific, one important one would be understanding any negative consequences. If somebody is advocating for a tax cut or the easing of Covid restrictions, what are the potential negative effects of doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Where your responsibility ends:</strong> When uncovering omitted information you may find that your questions are answered unsatisfactorily or not at all. You’ve done your job. Remember that all reasoning is incomplete. Your job is to determine whether or not this omitted information prevents you from coming to a conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="What-reasonable-conclusions-are-possible?">What reasonable conclusions are possible?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-reasonable-conclusions-are-possible?">&#182;</a></h3><ul>
<li><strong>The limitations of dichotomous thinking:</strong> few important questions can be answered with a “yes” or a “no”. Yet, questions are often phrased in a way that asks for such an answer. For example, “Should the US engage in peacekeeping in other countries?”. Dichotomous thinking narrows our perspective and underplays the importance of context for a particular answer. We can avoid dichotomous thinking by qualifying conclusions with if statements: We can put a conclusion into context by asking;<ul>
<li>When is it accurate?</li>
<li>Where is it accurate?</li>
<li>Why or for what reasons is it accurate?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coming back to our question, “Should the US engage in peacekeeping in other countries?”, we could arrive at multiple conclusions including:<ul>
<li>Yes, the US should engage in peacekeeping when its economic interests are at risk.</li>
<li>No, the US should engage in peacekeeping because it has enough domestic problems to manage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The same reasons can support multiple conclusions:</strong> Consider the following example from the book</p>
<blockquote><p>Conclusion: The United States should continue to use the death penalty as a form of punishment.
Reasons: i) Without the death penalty, there is no way to punish people who commit wrongs, such as harming guards or inmates, after already having a life sentence. ii) It is only fair that someone should die for purposely taking the life of another.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming that these reasons are correct, we could draw multiple conclusions. The author’s conclusion is one of them, but the reasons also support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The United States should continue to use the death penalty as a form of punishment when a person has harmed a guard or inmate or already been sentenced to life. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><del>Should we do X?</del> → What should we do about Y?:</strong>  Should we do something type questions pull you into a “yes” or “no” answer. A good strategy to broaden your thinking is to take a step back and consider the problem you’re facing (the Y).  Consider the following example from the book<ul>
<li>Should we close the bars downtown? The answer is a resounding yes! Since the bars opened, a dozen young college students have suffered from alcohol poisoning.</li>
<li>If you reframe the question as “What should we do about the number of college students suffering from alcohol poisoning?”, we can broaden our thinking and potentially come to better solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
